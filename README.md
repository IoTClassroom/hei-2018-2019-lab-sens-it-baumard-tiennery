### Sens'it development environment

1. Download and install [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain version 7.2.1](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).

2. Download and install [dfu-util 0.9](http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/).

3. Edit `./sensit-sdk-v2.0.0/sdk/Makefile`:

    * Make sure your `CC`, `BIN_TOOL`, `SIZE_TOOL` paths links to the right folder.
    * Example:
        ```
        CC = /Users/antoine/Documents/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2018-q2-update/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc
        BIN_TOOL  = /Users/antoine/Documents/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2018-q2-update/bin/arm-none-eabi-objcopy
        SIZE_TOOL = /Users/antoine/Documents/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2018-q2-update/bin/arm-none-eabi-size
        ```
4. **Copy** and **paste** the content of `main_TEMPERATURE.c` in `main.c`.

## Program your Sens'it

To program your Sens'it you will need to put it in bootloader:
1. Connect your device to your computer.
2. Reset your device. With one of the provided firmwares you can do this with 4 short presses on the button.
3. When the secondary LED starts blinking, do a long press on the button.
4. If both LEDs become white, your device is in bootloader.

Then, use the `make prog` command to program your Sens'it.

### Hint

If you want to return to the original firmware of the Sens'it 3, use the following command to program it:
```
dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x08000000:leave -D bin/sensit_discovery_vX.X.X.bin
```
Replace `X.X.X` with the current version of the Discovery firmware available in the `bin` folder.

### Don't forget to:

1. Create a new `README.md` file in your repo.
2. Insert:
```
My Sens'it ID: <YOUR_SENSIT_ID>
```
